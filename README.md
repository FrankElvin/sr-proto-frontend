# sr-proto-frontend
Frontend for a prototype project (Elm front querying Graphql-exposing backend)

Backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/FrankElvin/sr-proto-backend)

Main file: [AllReports](./src/AllReports.elm), allows to load all reports from the database table via backend and filter page data.

**Project is mostly finished**

It's planned to use the [Bulma CSS framework](https://bulma.io) to make the report page more friendly.
